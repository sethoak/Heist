# cSharpHeist

## A C# Exercise
You are poor. After much, deep consideration, it occurs to you that if you were to get some money, you wouldn't be so poor.

With this insight you begin to consider where to get money... Banks have money, you think to yourself, maybe I could take some of that. Thus, your dream of a bank heist is born.

Even though you are amazing at everything you do, you realize you cannot rob a bank alone. You'll need a team. But who should you recruit? Of course, you have a rolodex full of criminal masterminds, but you must be selective. Invite too many and each person's take is too small. Invite too few and your heist will fail. Also, you realize, you'll need to take luck (random chance) into account.

Maybe you could write a C# program to help you?
